# freeCodeCamp - Kolehiyolo's freeCodeCamp Projects
Welcome! I am a budding coder and this is a collection of all my freeCodeCamp projects.

In here you can see all of my project submissions assigned by freeCodeCamp that utilizes specific technologies and skills. I've compiled their links into this  little web app that sorts them by appropriate categories, but the projects themselves are hosted in their own individual repos.

## Overview
### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- See my projects in a categorized setting
- Get access to all links and related resources
- Get insight into brief overviews of each project
- Get access to links to my other projects/links outside of freeCodeCamp
- See my freeCodeCamp certifications

### Project List
#### Responsive Web Design
The projects under Responsive Web Design have sample CodePens where you can what product is expected, and as I understand, we're not really required to copy the samples to a tee. However, to fully stretch my coding prowess with HTML and CSS as well as to train my eye when observing minute design details such as responsive CSS changes, I decided to fully emulate the pages as seen.
- Build a Tribute Page
- Build a Survey Form
- Build a Product Landing Page
- Build a Technical Documentation Page
- Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

#### JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures
The projects under JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures are purely console-based and we were not expected to make visible pages. It's more about solving specific coding problems, which I enjoyed a lot, but I haven't finished the last 2 as of yet. I still haven't completed the remainder of the course yet so I wanted to postpone doing the actual projects. That being said, I still plan on making actual web pages that make use of the solutions in this Certification, such as a site that checks if a string is a Palindrome, etc. We'll see.
- Palindrome Checker
- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesars Cipher
- Telephone Number Validator
- Cash Register

### What I learned
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
